\title{Calculate proportion of runs that have controlled outbreak}
\usage{
extinct_prob(outbreak_df_week = NULL, cap_cases = NULL, week_range = 12:16)
}
\arguments{
\item{outbreak_df_week}{a \code{data.table}: weekly cases produced by the
outbreak model}

\item{cap_cases}{a positive \code{integer} scalar: number of cumulative cases at
which the branching process (simulation) was terminated}

\item{week_range}{a positive \code{integer} vector: giving the (zero indexed)
week range to test for whether an extinction occurred.}
}
\value{
a single \code{numeric} with the probability of extinction
}
\description{
Calculate proportion of runs that have controlled outbreak
