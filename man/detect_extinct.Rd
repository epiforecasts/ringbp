\title{Calculate whether outbreaks went extinct or not}
\usage{
detect_extinct(outbreak_df_week, cap_cases, week_range = 12:16)
}
\arguments{
\item{outbreak_df_week}{a \code{data.table}: weekly cases produced by the
outbreak model}

\item{cap_cases}{a positive \code{integer} scalar: number of cumulative cases at
which the branching process (simulation) was terminated}

\item{week_range}{a positive \code{integer} vector: giving the (zero indexed)
week range to test for whether an extinction occurred. Default is \code{12:16}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table}, with two columns \code{sim} and \code{extinct}, for a binary
classification of whether the outbreak went extinct in each simulation
replicate. \code{1} is an outbreak that went extinct, \code{0} if not.
}
\description{
Calculate whether outbreaks went extinct or not
}
\details{
The \code{cap_cases} argument should be equal to the value supplied to
\code{\link[=outbreak_model]{outbreak_model()}} (possibly passed from \code{\link[=scenario_sim]{scenario_sim()}}).
