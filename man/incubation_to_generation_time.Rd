\title{Convert symptom onset times to generation times}
\usage{
incubation_to_generation_time(
  symptom_onset_time,
  exposure_time = rep(0, length(symptom_onset_time)),
  alpha,
  latent_period = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{symptom_onset_time}{a positive \code{numeric} vector: symptom onset time(s)
of the infector(s) in the case data. The symptom onset times are generated
by sampling from the incubation period.}

\item{exposure_time}{a non-negative \code{numeric} vector: time of exposure of
the infector(s) in the case data. Used to convert symptom onset in absolute
time to relative time for each infectee. Default is for all exposure
times to be 0.}

\item{alpha}{a \code{numeric} scalar: skew parameter of the skew-normal
distribution. Used to model the relationship between incubation period and
generation time.}

\item{latent_period}{a non-negative \code{numeric} scalar: the minimum time
between an individual being exposed and becoming infectious. It is a
population-wide parameter, with no variability between individuals. It
sets the minimum generation time in the model. Default is 0 (i.e.
an individual becomes immediately infectious after being infected).

If \code{latent_period} is positive then generation times are sampled
conditional on \code{gt >= latent_period} (i.e. left-truncated at
\code{latent_period}). This may reduce the realised proportion of
presymptomatic transmission, depending on the \code{incubation_period}
distribution and \code{presymptomatic_transmission} (in \code{\link[=event_prob_opts]{event_prob_opts()}}).}
}
\value{
a \code{numeric} vector of generation times of equal length to the vector
input to \code{symptom_onset_time}: the i-th element of the vector contains a
sample from the generation time distribution of an individual with
incubation period given by the i-th element of the \code{symptom_onset_time}
vector. The lower bound of the output generation time vector is set by the
\code{latent_period}, to prevent transmission before becoming infectious.
}
\description{
Samples generation times from a skew-normal distribution based on relative
symptom onset times (\code{symptom_onset_time} - \code{exposure_time}), ensuring all
generation times are at least \code{latent_period}. The location parameter of the
skew-normal distribution is set to the relative symptom onset times.
