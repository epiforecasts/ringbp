# Control whether outbreak simulation continues stepping

Used in a while loop to determine whether the
[`outbreak_model()`](https://epiforecasts.io/ringbp/reference/outbreak_model.md)
continues to call
[`outbreak_step()`](https://epiforecasts.io/ringbp/reference/outbreak_step.md),
or to end the simulation.

## Usage

``` r
outbreak_continue(case_data, sim)
```

## Arguments

- case_data:

  a `data.table`: cases in outbreak so far; initially generated by
  [`outbreak_setup()`](https://epiforecasts.io/ringbp/reference/outbreak_setup.md)

- sim:

  a `list` with class `<ringbp_sim_opts>`: the simulation control
  options for the ringbp model, returned by
  [`sim_opts()`](https://epiforecasts.io/ringbp/reference/sim_opts.md)

## Value

a `logical` scalar: whether the outbreak is still active and should
continue (`TRUE`) or if the outbreak is extinct or has reached a
stopping criterion (`FALSE`).
